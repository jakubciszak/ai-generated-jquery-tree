It will also link to the CSS and JavaScript files.\n\n2. `styles.css`: This CSS file will contain the styles for the category tree and checkboxes.\n\n3. `script.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the logic for showing and hiding subcategories and for the \"select/deselect all\" button.\n\nLet's start with the `index.html` file:\n\nindex.html\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Category Tree</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div id=\"tree\">\n        <!-- The category tree will be dynamically generated here -->\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNext, we'll create the `styles.css` file:\n\nstyles.css\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n}\n\n#tree {\n    margin: 20px;\n}\n\n.category {\n    margin-left: 20px;\n}\n\n.checkbox {\n    margin-right: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we'll create the `script.js` file:\n\nscript.js\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // Define the category tree\n    var tree = [\n        {\n            name: 'Category 1',\n            subcategories: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Subcategory 1.1',\n                    subcategories: []\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Subcategory 1.2',\n                    subcategories: []\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            name: 'Category 2',\n            subcategories: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Subcategory 2.1',\n                    subcategories: []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ];\n\n    // Function to create a category\n    function createCategory(category) {\n        var $category = $('<div class=\"category\"></div>');\n        var $checkbox = $('<input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"checkbox\">');\n        var $name = $('<span></span>').text(category.name);\n        var $button = $('<button class=\"toggle\">+</button>');\n        $category.append($checkbox, $name, $button);\n\n        // Create subcategories\n        var $subcategories = $('<div class=\"subcategories\"></div>').hide();\n        category.subcategories.forEach(function(subcategory) {\n            $subcategories.append(createCategory(subcategory));\n        });\n        $category.append($subcategories);\n\n        // Toggle subcategories\n        $button.click(function() {\n            $subcategories.toggle();\n            $button.text($subcategories.is(':visible') ? '-' : '+');\n        });\n\n        // Select/deselect all subcategories\n        $checkbox.change(function() {\n            $subcategories.find('.checkbox').prop('checked', $checkbox.is(':checked'));\n        });\n\n        return $category;\n    }\n\n    // Create the category tree\n    tree.forEach(function(category) {\n        $('#tree').append(createCategory(category));\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis code creates a simple category tree with checkboxes. The categories and subcategories are defined in the `tree` variable. The `createCategory` function creates a category with a checkbox, a name, a button to toggle the visibility of the subcategories, and the subcategories themselves. The \"select/deselect all\" functionality is implemented in the `change` event handler of the checkbox. The category tree is created by appending each category to the `#tree` element."}]
